<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Abdul, I’ve been studying computer science for two years. 
  In order to kick-start my career before I graduate, 
  I want become a web developer ,
  As I enjoying making websites. 
  since that’s what I’ve been doing already for one years in my free time. 
  Designing websites for friends, developing simple projects with the help of some
   angela yu's Web development Course, 
   and so on.

<p>Besides that I am a normal 
  guy who enjoys playing football and spending time with friends or family, 
  while not working or studying, which takes most of my time of course.</p>

<p>If I should pick the best website I’ve designed up to this point, 
  it will be this one: [www.apple.com]. 
  I am ambitious and hard-working and believed that consistency and hardwork is a key success.</p>
